# hibiki
<a href="http://musicpd.org">Music Player Daemon</a> integration with the <a href="https://awesome.naquadah.org">awesome window manager</a>.

# Project outline
	<ul>
		<li>Firstly, <i>hibiki</i> shall provide a Lua library giving access to all capabilities of the MPD protocol.</li>
		<li>Secondly, it shall offer methods one can use to construct a graphical MPD client based off the awesome window manager's Lua API.</li>
		<li>Thirdly, it shall provide MPD status displays by the means of awesome's <i>naughty</i> nofification and <i>vicious</i> widget library.</li>
	</ul>
	In its implementation, <i>hibiki</i> shant use any library or tool that hant been already put to use by the <i>awesome</i> developers and depend on more things as necessary. With <i>hibiki</i>, I set out both to master the Lua programming language (the earlier, the better, I assume), so in any part of the code, there might be a crux ... well, participants are welcome.
